# How To Docker

This is a template / reference repo for adding docker to projects.
I made this for a presentation to my university's Senior Seminar class,
where students are building some really cool, semester long projects.

## Presentation

To view the presentation, you can download [slides](https://github.com/maaslalani/slides) and run
`slides slides.md`, or just open the `slides.md` file with your preferred markdown viewer.
